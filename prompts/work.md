Refer to the following documents for context on the project:
1. docs/design.md
2. docs/onboarding_and_testing_functions.md

Let's continue working on the fat strings subsystem.
I want to onboard these functions:

HasPrefix(s, prefix string) bool
HasSuffix(s, suffix string) bool

I expect the Go bindings, C bindings, and a unit test in Python.
