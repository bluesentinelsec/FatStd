Refer to docs/design.md to understand my project.

Currently we have a trivial C function, and also a Python script to test the shared library via ctypes.

The next thing I want to do is add a trivial Go function to fatstd.
The specific function does not matter, what matters is proving that code in C can invoke a function written in Go.

Confirm understanding and propose a solution.
